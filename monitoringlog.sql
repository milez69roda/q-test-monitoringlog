How do you feel about the call? All present were in alignment that the rep was knowledged base and was able to assist the customer howeve the opportunity to better assit the customer was apparent with tonality in which the rep used.  We feel the rep could have been more accomodating by offering explainations to the customer in refernce to why the rep was asking multiple question to set up his account.  Also the rep came across mostly curt to the customer when asking the questions.  Almost aggressive like.\r\n2. What would you have done differently or better?  Again all were in agreement with comments like being more jolly, accomodating and leaving the customer with a good feeling of our company. \r\n3. What have you learned from the call? The rep definitely needs more calls monitored to see if there is a trend with the rep on all calls with this type of attitude of being curt to the customer.\r\n4. What are your recommendations and would you do to support or assist the agent:  Supervisor has committed to monitor the rep on a few calls without the rep having knowledge of it to determine if it is a trend with the rep or maybe he was having a bad day when the call was being recorded.  The support will come when the rep listens to this call and the feedback from the Supervisor and answers the same questions posed in our meeting calibration and report back his answers and suggestions.  Training in Bacolod would like to add this type of scenario to their current mock calls for they do cover Customer Service on the first day but realize that maybe there may be an opportunity to have better focus on Customer Service to ensure this type of issue is covered from day one and how to handle and improve on being Curt.  Neno-liked these types of questions that I have posed to them today and may want to do a mini-calibration using these types of questions during New Hire Training. \r\n\r\nThe following is the feedback provided by the center: Please see items below on the actions taken by Supervisor Mark and the information he has gathered from the call monitoring and coaching he has done to his agent  Arwin John Magada (46996).\r\n\r\nSupervisor Mark was able to monitor a total of 3 calls from agent Arwin.  According to Mark, he was able to provide coaching to Arwin last April 1, and as what Mark has observed, the agent was responsive to the coaching and showed improvement. Based on the Supervisor’s observation, the agent has the tendency to get slightly tensed whenever the customer asks for the same information.  This observation was the main focus of the Supervisor’s coaching.  So far, based on the feedback from Supervisor Mark, the agent is now able to maintain composure and is now able to control and improve his tone of voice.\r\n\r\nHere are the details on the 3 calls that were monitored:\r\n\r\nAvaya  Name  Time Areas of Success Areas of Opportunities  Supervisor  Date\r\n46996 Magada, Arwin John 10:07 Activation:\r\n\r\nThere is significant improvement in the call. CSR had a very pleasant interaction with the customer.   Mark David Ortaliz 4/4/2013\r\n46996 Magada, Arwin John 10:46 Data Service - CSR provided APN settings to the customer\'s. Customer\'s phone is now working. Observed a little tension in the CSR\'s voice when customer asked CSR to repeat the settings. But CSR was able to tone down. Mark David Ortaliz 4/4/2013\r\n46996 Magada, Arwin John 11:03 Phone Upgrade - Phone belongs to another account. CSR removed ESN. Process lead to a sim replacement. CSR was able to resolve the call. Observed a little tension in the CSR\'s voice when customer would ask for an explanation. But CSR was able to tone down. Mark David Ortaliz 4/4/2013\r\n\r\n\r\nSupervisor Mark instructed agent Arwin to listen to the recording and here are the agent’s feedback and commitment:\r\n\r\n1. How do you feel about the call?\r\nArwin explained that he sounded sleepy during the call. He was still tired and worn out after coming back from his leave. According to the agent, his mind was not yet in 100% work mode.\r\n\r\n2. What would you have done differently or better?\r\nArwin explained that he could have been more upbeat and energetic and that he could have set his mind towards work.\r\n\r\n3. What have you learned from the call?\r\nAfter being able to observe an example of bad customer service, Arwin committed to do much better with his calls moving forward.  Tone of voice and attitude towards work are the key things that should be observed for us to provide quality customer service to our customers.','0','2013-04-04 15:44:13',17,'10.248.106.53',4,'Group Meeting','2013-04-07','2013-04-05 11:17:47',17),(182,'64761 - Data Call','2013-04-04','Gerald- Miami Manager\r\nJoe Aparecio- Cebu Manager\r\nMelcy - Agent\r\nRhiam- Sup',4,'Met with Cebu regarding a call that was monitored, I advised the agent on how to handle data gator calls and what lind of information can be given to a customer regarding high data.\r\n\r\nThe center also explaned that the other 2 Simple Mobile centers are transfering high data customers to the supervisor queue.

These options will be added to the Agent Support & will allow agents to send the App Link as well as instructions over to the customer via text message.\r\n? Training Flash#62:/Job Aid Net10 Wireless Homephone:\r\n? NT Wireless Homephone Device (Huawei T226C) was released.\r\n? Centers: Miami, Bogota & Barranquilla were skilled to take these calls.\r\n? These calls can be handled by all agents however for escalations these calls should be transferred to the VAS Team.\r\n? Training Flash #73- Registering A New Credit Card:\r\n? Agents should ensure that the entire billing address is updated when making a purchase for customers, if this information is not updated then the agent will receive an error & the purchase will be unsuccessful.\r\n? If the billing information entered is incomplete or entered incorrectly, you will receive this error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n? ILD Mini Site:\r\n? Agent Support was updated & now has the ILD Mini Site which has the most pertinent information as it relates to ILD for all brands.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUpdates\r\n? Handset Refund Tool Update:\r\n? This tool can be found within TAS & can be used to verify if customers have returned their handsets & if a refund was issued. It also shows if the customer received a full or a partial refund.\r\n? All centers should be using this tool since calls are being transferred to Miami ERD unnecessarily. \r\n? Training Flash#74: Straight Talk Pay as You Go ILD Service to be Discontinued:\r\n? ST Pay As You Go service will be replaced with a $10 Global Card as of May 16th.\r\n? Agents should not create cases for unable to buy through FLEXICARE but should advise the customer of the information found in TF #74.\r\n? Requests for new users IDs for FLEXICARE should not be sent to DSE since this tool is being replaced.\r\n? Benefits of this airtime card will roll over.\r\n? This airtime card is stackable which therefore means that more that one can be purchased at a time.\r\n? All destinations are included.\r\n? Customer Satisfaction Credit Update:\r\n? This data for this report has dropped significantly however, the main reason for the choosing this drop down remains to be because the agent mistakenly selected the drop down. Please ensure that this is reiterated to the agents to ensure that this behavior is curbed.\r\n\r\nSuggestion From Cebu: ? A ticket creation guide should be added to the ILD MINI Site that should state when & why tickets can be created.\r\nConclusion: ? Elias Nortelus: this information will be updated shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nNo Questions From Centers: ? Belize\r\n? Honduras\r\n? Guyana\r\n? Dumaguete\r\n? Bacolod\r\n?

The total WAP Access Charge will vary depending on the size of the multi-media message being sent or received.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nWe have an FCC complaint where the customer states we are not charging him correctly when sending MMS pictures.  I believe he is looking at the terms and conditions (above) but seeing that we are deducting more.  He is right, we are deducting 0.015 units per kilobytes.  So if his picture he is sending is 459k, we are deducting 6.88 units.  We’ve been told not to communicate the 0.015 number to the customer.  \r\n\r\nI believe that we should make sure the terms and conditions are relaying correct information because the agents are referring the customers to the Terms and condition and customer are reading the wrong inform.\r\n','2013-04-10 16:22:23',30,'10.248.3.81','2013-04-14',NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(261,2,'create new profile in mobile sphere with will allow agents to determin weather customer abused their 400 mobile to mobile units balance.
