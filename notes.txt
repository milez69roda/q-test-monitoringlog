Create a New Tab called: Overview
-this tab will be the first tab in the tool on the far left
-NOTE:the second tab should be Call Log Tab, then Meeting Log Tab, the Recommendations Log Tab, then Reports Tab
-the Overview Tab should be a tab that tracks how far away from the goal each week each person is from their entries.
-the metrics to load in are as follows:
•	30 + weeks completed all three entries into the log (25 calls logged per person by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 meeting logged by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 recommendation logged by end of week Sunday 9pm)= score of a 5
•	25-29 weeks completed all three entries into the log (25 calls logged per person by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 meeting logged by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 recommendation logged by end of week Sunday 9pm)= score of a 4
•	20-24 weeks completed all three entries into the log (25 calls logged per person by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 meeting logged by end of week Sunday 9pm/1 recommendation logged by end of week Sunday 9pm)= score of a 3
•	So this tab is a scoring tab and will track the individual score achieved daily toward that week’s goal and the year to date results as well.
•	This tab will also track the department score the same way and also the enterprise score the same way.
